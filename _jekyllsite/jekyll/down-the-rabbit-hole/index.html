Created a site, found a theme, installed some gems, bundled something and now you have some html served up on port 4000. But wait a minute, now your console is full of warnings:  Sass 4.0 deprecated function call     DEPRECATION WARNING: Passing a string to call() is deprecated and will be illegal in Sass 4.0. Use call(get-function(“mixin-exists”)) instead.   Ok, that should be easily fixed, just update the theme:     RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES (7):    jekyll ~&gt; 3.6   Oh right, you’re running jekyll 3.5, time to upgrade! You better use ridk, and where’s msys2:     MSYS2 could not be found.    Please download and install MSYS2 from https://msys2.github.io/   Fine, I’ll just install msys2:     :: msys2-runtime and catgets are in conflict. Remove catgets? [y/N]   Ah of course, the old catgets, who invited you to the party anyway.     Dependency Error: Yikes! It looks like you don’t have jekyll-remote-theme or one of its dependencies installed. In order to use Jekyll as currently configured , you’ll need to install this gem. The full error message from Ruby is: ‘Could n ot open library ‘libcurl’: (illegal characters) .
